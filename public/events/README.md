# Event Photos Setup

## Instructions for Adding Your Event Photos

The landing page now features 6 floating 3D card bubbles that display event photos. Currently, placeholder images are being used. Follow these steps to replace them with your actual event photos:

### Required Images

Replace the following files in this directory (`public/events/`) with your event photos:

1. **car-meetup.jpg** - MCR Car Meetup (racing event)
2. **networking-event.jpg** - Ecom Networking Event (professional networking)
3. **outdoor-event.jpg** - MashoMa3na (outdoor/nature event)
4. **workshop-event.jpg** - Tote Bag Painting Workshop (creative workshop)
5. **dinner-event.jpg** - Meet and Greet Kinda-B-Canada (dinner/social event)
6. **fitness-event.jpg** - Walk Club Beirut (walking/fitness event)

### How to Replace

1. Save each of the 6 event images you uploaded earlier with the exact filenames listed above
2. Place them in the `public/events/` directory
3. The images should be in JPG format (PNG will also work)
4. Recommended image dimensions: 800x800px or larger (square aspect ratio works best)
5. Restart your development server if it's running to see the changes

### Image Guidelines

- Use high-quality, well-lit photos
- Square or near-square aspect ratio recommended
- File size: Keep under 500KB for optimal performance
- The images will be automatically optimized by Next.js Image component

Once you replace the placeholder images, the floating card bubbles will display your actual event photos with beautiful 3D animations!
